This blog project is built with Html , css, python , flask framework , jinja2 templates , SQLAlchemy , bootstrap and a line of Javascript . I made use of my knowledge of flask to create the database using SQLAlchemy and sqlite .

The blog site is properly authenticated , and pays attention to the tiniest details . Anyone can access the blog and read the post either signed in or not , but however , you're only restricted to some certain features such as reading of blogpost, about , and you can also contact us .

I made use of python { if statement }to validate the forms properly , and I also made use of flash messages to help a user in navigating the signup and login forms .

Your username length is not limited , you can make use of a single letter or 26letters to create a username, but however , your password must be less than 8 .

As an authenticated user , you have the ability to create post , edit post and delete post and it's only limited to authenticated users , which means , you've to be signed in before you could access the full flex of the blog site.

I tried to be as creative as possible without making use of bootstrap , hence the classes are named differently, in other to create an avenue for me to design the site properties individually using css .
I couldnt add the edit and delete due to reasons beyond my control , hope to do that soonest
